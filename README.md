# PVPScores
A plugin that gives server owners an easy way to manage PVP matches and scoreboards.
## Dependencies
<a href="http://scriptcraftjs.org">ScriptCraft</a><br>
This plugin (like ScriptCraft) works with any Bukkit/Spigot server.
## Installation
Install <a href="http://scriptcraftjs.org">ScriptCraft</a>, download the latest PVPScores release <a href="https://github.com/bitsol/PVPScores/archive/master.zip">from here</a>, and extract the zip folder to your ScriptCraft plugin directory.
## Usage
All of the commands are ops-only (for good reason!)
Here is a (sort of) up-to-date list of commands:
<br>/js startMatch()<br>/js endMatch()<br>/js resetScores()
